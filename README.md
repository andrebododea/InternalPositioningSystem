# Internal Positioning System Android App

An app that allows users to track themselves indoors where GPS tracking is ineffective, by use of RSSI scans (WiFi). Allows users to train various floor plans and saves these trainings so that tracking becomes more effective the more users use the app.

For more **information** and **screen shots** from the app, check out the [extended document PDF](https://github.com/andrebododea/InternalPositioningSystem/blob/master/Latex_Writeup/report/es2.pdf) for the app.
